I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) and Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS), CAS, advised by Prof. [Zhi-Ming Ma](http://homepage.amss.ac.cn/research/homePage/8eb59241e2e74d828fb84eec0efadba5/myHomePage.html). I work on the theory, algorithmically efficient training, and inference of scalable generative models.

Currently, I am a research intern at Adobe Research, supervised by [Chongjian Ge](https://chongjiange.github.io). I was previously a visiting student at Columbia University and a research intern at the AI Theory Group in Noah's Ark Lab, where I worked closely with [Mingyang Yi](https://mingyangyi.github.io), [Tianyang Hu](https://hu-tianyang.github.io), [Zhaoqiang Liu](https://sites.google.com/site/liuzhaoqiang2016/), [Enze Xie](https://xieenze.github.io). I received my B.S. degree in Mathematics from the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS).
